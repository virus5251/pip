# pip
pip installation process

If Pip is not installed, you will get an error message stating that the program is not found. To Install Pip Follow the steps:

1.Download get-pip.py(https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to a folder on your computer.

2.Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the get-pip.py installer.

3.Run the command: python get-pip.py

We can now verify that Pip was installed correctly by opening a command prompt and entering the command: pip -V

If you didn't get any error message then pip is installed Correctly. Now type pip install numpy in command prompt.

And now Numpy will be installed correctly and we are good to go :)

Thank You.
